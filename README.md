## Introduction
Analyzing source code manually can be error-prone and time-consuming, especially when identifying different components such as keywords, identifiers, and constants. This project automates that process, making it easy to extract these elements from any code file. The program reads the code, removes comments, and outputs recognized keywords, constants, and identifiers to an output file.

## Features
- **Keyword Detection:** Identifies predefined keywords from a customizable list.
- **Identifier Recognition:** Recognizes valid identifiers based on syntax rules.
- **Constant Extraction:** Extracts constants, including integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Comment Removal:** Supports both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments.
- **Output to File:** Writes recognized elements to an output file for easy reference.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Programming language used for implementing the analyzer.
- **Standard Libraries**: Includes `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<string>`, `<algorithm>`, `<vector>`, and `<unordered_set>`.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- Basic knowledge of C++ syntax and file handling

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Keyword-Identifier-Analyzer.git
   cd Keyword-Identifier-Analyzer
